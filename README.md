## Contributing to the Wiki

### Rules

* If in doubt, ask in an issue first.
* Don't repeat what is already written in ungoogled-chromium documentation. The Wiki is only supposed to supplement what is there.
* Use common sense

### Submitting

Using PRs and issues are preferred over directly pushing. Direct pushes are fine for small changes (e.g. changing the Statuses page).

If you are a contributor to ungoogled-chromium, you can request to be part of the [ungoogled-software wiki-team](https://github.com/orgs/ungoogled-software/teams/wiki-team) for direct access to this repository.
