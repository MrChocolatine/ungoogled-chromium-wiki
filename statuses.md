# Determining platform status

Essentially, platforms are broken up into one or more configurations, e.g. each major version for a Linux distribution can be a distinct configuration, or *config bundle*. Thus, platform status can be determined by the tags for which a config bundle works.

Platform status can be supplemented with the status of [binaries on the downloads page](https://ungoogled-software.github.io/ungoogled-chromium-binaries/). Each binary can be traced back to the corresponding config bundle using the building instructions.

# Latest testing tags

Tags that are ready for testing are listed in the following table. For tags ready for general use, see the downloads page.

**Note for contributors**: Please update the table whenever a config bundle is updated.

In the event that the following table is inconsistent with the downloads page, pick the information with the newer tags.
